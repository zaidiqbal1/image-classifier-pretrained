# Image Classifier Using a Pre-trained Model

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **image classification system** using a **pre-trained deep learning model**.  
It demonstrates:
- Loading and using pre-trained models from popular frameworks
- Image preprocessing for prediction
- Model inference for classifying images into categories
- Evaluation and accuracy calculation

## 🛠️ Features
- Pre-trained model loading (e.g., ResNet, VGG, MobileNet, etc.)
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, tensor conversion)
- Prediction for single and multiple images
- Model performance evaluation
- Easy customization for different datasets
